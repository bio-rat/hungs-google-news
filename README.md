## User Stories

The following **required** functionalities are completed (this is a sample):

* [x] The user can see a list of the 20 latest top news stories, loaded dynamically from newsapi.
* [x] For each story, the user sees a headline, the source, a link to more, and an image. 
* [x] The user can see the total number of stories currently shown.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] The user can click a link at the bottom of the page to load the next 20 stories. The page should not refresh; the stories should simply be added to the bottom. 
* [x] The user can see an updated number of stories currently shown.
* [x] The user can see how long ago the story was published in a human-friendly format; e.g. "15 minutes ago".

The following **Rocket Challenge 1: Sources** features are implemented:

* [ ] The user can see a checkbox for every unique source of the articles loaded. For example, if the user loads four stories, and two stories are from bbc-news, one from cnn, and one from spiegel-de, the user would see three checkboxes: bbc-news, cnn, spiegel-de. 
* [ ] Next to the source name, the user sees a number representing the number of stories from that source. To continue the previous example: bbc-news (2), cnn (1), spiegel-de (1).
* [ ] The user can toggle the checkbox to hide or show stories from that source in the list.
